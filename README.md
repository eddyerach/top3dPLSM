# top3dPLSM
top3dPLSM is an efficient Matlab code to solve three-dimensional topology optimization problems. The 251 lines comprising this code include radial basis function interpolation, finite element analysis,optimality criterion optimizer, and display of results. The basic code solves minimum compliance problems with pre defined supports and loads. These boundary conditions can be easily modified.

## Quick Start
Save the program [top3dPLSM.m](top3dPLSM.m) and start MATLAB in the same directory. The program can be promoted by line
`top3dPLSM(30,10,2,0.5)`
